            8/21/23 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned what a Rube <br>
            Rube Goldberg machine is. I  also learned how to keep myself safe in <br>
            class. We saw different videos on how to keep ourselves safe, what <br>
            the consequences are for not keeping yourself safe, and what may <br>
            happen if you don't use the proper safety materials. I also <br>
            learned basic codes amd how to use AWS. We got introduced <br>
            to different websites including GitHub. To end our week we did <br>
            a game with marbles and sticks to see which team could finish <br>
            the fastest. <br>

            8/28/23 - 9/01/2023 Week 2 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned how to use <br>
            TinkerCad and we took our first quiz. We learned more about <br>
            Mechanical Engineering and safety in engineering class. <br>
            Ms. Petrosian showed us multiple videos on safety, and <br>
            one on ivention and innovation. We began to plan out our <br>
            Rube Goldberg machines with our groups and began to build <br>
            it on TinkerCad. We also took notes on mechanical engineering <br>
            safety, and how to be successful in the engineering process.<br>

            9/05/23 - 9/08/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we started our first phase of <br>
            building our Rube Goldberg machines. We came across some <br>
            complications but soon overcame them and began our project.<br>
            We used our example from TinkerCad to help us build it.<br>
            We built the layout of the project and are looking for more <br>
            inspiration to help us build the machine. <br>
