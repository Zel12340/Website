            8/21/23 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned what a Rube <br>
            Rube Goldberg machine is. I  also learned how to keep myself safe in <br>
            class. We saw different videos on how to keep ourselves safe, what <br>
            the consequences are for not keeping yourself safe, and what may <br>
            happen if you don't use the proper safety materials. I also <br>
            learned basic codes amd how to use AWS. We got introduced <br>
            to different websites including GitHub. To end our week we did <br>
            a game with marbles and sticks to see which team could finish <br>
            the fastest. <br>

            8/28/23 - 9/01/2023 Week 2 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned how to use <br>
            TinkerCad and we took our first quiz. We learned more about <br>
            Mechanical Engineering and safety in engineering class. <br>
            Ms. Petrosian showed us multiple videos on safety, and <br>
            one on ivention and innovation. We began to plan out our <br>
            Rube Goldberg machines with our groups and began to build <br>
            it on TinkerCad. We also took notes on mechanical engineering <br>
            safety, and how to be successful in the engineering process.<br>

            9/05/23 - 9/08/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we started our first phase of <br>
            building our Rube Goldberg machines. We came across some <br>
            complications but soon overcame them and began our project.<br>
            We used our example from TinkerCad to help us build it.<br>
            We built the layout of the project and are looking for more <br>
            inspiration to help us build the machine. <br>

            9/11/23 - 9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we finished our Rube <br>
            Goldberg Machines. Due to my partner being sick and having <br>
            to leave multiple groups, we fell behind but still managed <br>
            to finish the project. It was a little frustrating to build it <br>
            but we came up with multiple different ideas and we were <br>
            successful. We failed multiple times but we fixed the problems <br>
            and learned from our mistakes. We're going to test our project <br>
            next Monday to see if our machine was a success. <br>

            9/18/23 - 9/22/23 Week 5 <br>
            Thi week in Intro to Engineering we did two different challenges. <br>
            We did a challenge on a flotation device to see whos could last <br>
            the longest. At first I wasn't positive that it was going to work <br>
            due to it being too heavy, but then I removed some weights and it <br>
            allowed it to float. Our second project was to make a paper E with <br>
            the proper dimensions. I made my 'E' a little too big causing the<br>
            person that built the 'E' to face complications. <br>
            
            </p>
            <p> 
            9/25/23 - 9/29/23 Week 6 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we dissected a computer. <br>
            We learned the different components and parts of a computer. <br> 
            We took a quiz on what we learned about the different parts <br>
            of a computer and on computer engineering. I feel like I learned <br>
            a lot more on what there is to know about engineering. I like the <br>
            fact that there's always something new to learn in the engineering <br>
            process. <br>
