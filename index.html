            8/21/23 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned what a Rube <br>
            Rube Goldberg machine is. I  also learned how to keep myself safe in <br>
            class. We saw different videos on how to keep ourselves safe, what <br>
            the consequences are for not keeping yourself safe, and what may <br>
            happen if you don't use the proper safety materials. I also <br>
            learned basic codes amd how to use AWS. We got introduced <br>
            to different websites including GitHub. To end our week we did <br>
            a game with marbles and sticks to see which team could finish <br>
            the fastest.
