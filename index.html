            8/21/23 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned what a Rube <br>
            Rube Goldberg machine is. I  also learned how to keep myself safe in <br>
            class. We saw different videos on how to keep ourselves safe, what <br>
            the consequences are for not keeping yourself safe, and what may <br>
            happen if you don't use the proper safety materials. I also <br>
            learned basic codes amd how to use AWS. We got introduced <br>
            to different websites including GitHub. To end our week we did <br>
            a game with marbles and sticks to see which team could finish <br>
            the fastest. <br>

            8/28/23 - 9/01/2023 Week 2 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned how to use <br>
            TinkerCad and we took our first quiz. We learned more about <br>
            Mechanical Engineering and safety in engineering class. <br>
            Ms. Petrosian showed us multiple videos on safety, and <br>
            one on ivention and innovation. We began to plan out our <br>
            Rube Goldberg machines with our groups and began to build <br>
            it on TinkerCad. We also took notes on mechanical engineering <br>
            safety, and how to be successful in the engineering process.<br>

            9/05/23 - 9/08/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we started our first phase of <br>
            building our Rube Goldberg machines. We came across some <br>
            complications but soon overcame them and began our project.<br>
            We used our example from TinkerCad to help us build it.<br>
            We built the layout of the project and are looking for more <br>
            inspiration to help us build the machine. <br>
            

            </p>
            
            <p>
            9/11/23 - 9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we finished our Rube <br>
            Goldberg Machines. Due to my partner being sick and having <br>
            to leave multiple groups, we fell behind but still managed <br>
            to finish the project. It was a little frustrating to build it <br>
            but we came up with multiple different ideas and we were <br>
            successful. We failed multiple times but we fixed the problems <br>
            and learned from our mistakes. We're going to test our project <br>
            next Monday to see if our machine was a success. <br>
            
            </p>
            <p>
            9/18/23 - 9/22/23 Week 5 <br>
            Thi week in Intro to Engineering we did two different challenges. <br>
            We did a challenge on a flotation device to see whos could last <br>
            the longest. At first I wasn't positive that it was going to work <br>
            due to it being too heavy, but then I removed some weights and it <br>
            allowed it to float. Our second project was to make a paper E with <br>
            the proper dimensions. I made my 'E' a little too big causing the<br>
            person that built the 'E' to face complications. <br>
            
            </p>
            <p> 
            9/25/23 - 9/29/23 Week 6 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we dissected a computer. <br>
            We learned the different components and parts of a computer. <br> 
            We took a quiz on what we learned about the different parts <br>
            of a computer and on computer engineering. I feel like I learned <br>
            a lot more on what there is to know about engineering. We did a <br>
            worksheet to remember how much we know about the different parts <br>
            inside a computer. Although I found it a little challenging I got <br>
            help and learned something new from it.<br>

            <p>
            10/02/23 - 10/06/23 Week 7 <br>
            This week in engineering we learned more about BioEngineering and <br>
            what it does to help people. We did a worksheet on it to help us <br>
            learn more about it and we did a project on it. We made prosthetic <br>
            hands using carboard to pick up a water bottle. It was kind of hard <br>
            to do because we kept messing up and we didn't know to do to fix it <br>
            and so it made the challenge more difficult for us. Also to help <br>
            us learn more about BioEngineering we did another assignment on <br>
            TinkerCad to make an animal prosthetic that works efficiently <br>
            for the animal. <br>
            
            </p>
            <p>
            10/09/23 - 10/14/23 Week 8 <br>
            This week in engineering we took a quiz on BioEngineering to test <br>
            our knowledge on the topic. We started a new topic on aerospace <br>
            engineering which I'm very interested in and want to learn more <br>
            about it. We're starting a new project next week and joined new <br>
            groups. I'm looking forward to the new project, making a rocket <br>
            out of a coke bottle, because it seems like a fun project <br>
            and I think it's something that can help me learn more about aerospace <br>
            engineering. Even thought it may be more challenging I feel like <br>
            it's something that can teach me more about what there is to know <br>
            about engineering.

            10/16/23 - 10/20/23 Week 9 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering, to help us learn more about <br>
            aerospace engineering, we made rockets out of coke bottles. <br>
            To make our bottle fly we gave it wings made out of cardboard. <br>
            We had to add the right amount of water to make sure that it flys <br>
            to the distance that we wanted it to go to. Overall, our test project <br>
            went really well and I expected it to be worst, it went pretty far <br>
            but it definitely went further then we thought it would've gone. <br>
            We used 50 pr and if we had to do something different I would <br>
            probably change the wings to make it fly more efficiently. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            10/23/23 - 10/27/23 Week 10 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineer we learned about environmental <br>
            engineering and I learned that evnironmental engineering <br>
            is meant to help the environment and find solutions <br>
            to the problems that our environment has. Our water clarification <br>
            project went really well and I think that the color was just a little <br>
            yellow at the end. The order of our project was first cotton then rocks <br>
            then pebbles then sand. Our water was sort of clear but it could've been <br> 
            clearer. I would put the rocks on the bottom then the cotton. <br>
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            10/30/23 - 11/03/23 Week 11 <br>
            This week in Engineerign we learned the basics of circuit boards <br>
            and what the different components on a circuit board are. We used <br>
            a breadboard on TinkerCad to help us learn more about circuit boards <br>
            by doing two labs. I found the labs really difficult to understand <br>
            because it seemed really complicated especially on lab two. I learned <br>
            what voltage is and how to measure it with a multimeter. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            11/06/23 - 11/10/23 Week 12 <br>
            During week 12 we learned how to use circuit boards which I found <br>
            really confusing. We used Arduino to code the circuit board and make it <br>
            have different lighting patterns. We coded it to turn the LEDs on the <br>
            circuit board on and off. I learned what the difference is with a parallel<br> circuit and a series circuit. The same amount of current <br>
            flows throughout what's placed on the circuit board and a parallel <br>
            is when the two LEDs are placed parallel to each other and the current <br>
            is split.

            <p>
            11/13/23 - 11/17/23 Week 13 <br>
            This week in Engineering we learned about Business Engineering <br>
            which I find really interesting because it's something that you <br>
            can see in a lot of different places throughout your life. <br>
            I learned that in order to learn business engineering you <br>
            need to understand design thinking, customer obsession, and <br>
            the different fields of business engineering and what they do. <br>
            We started a project on making our own product and being able to <br>
            sell it successfully by creating slides based off of Shark Tank <br>
            to test our knowledge. My idea was to create a mascara that has a <br>
            serum in it that allows your eyelashes to grow healthier and more <br>
            efficiently and include a mascara that doesn't damage your eyelashes. <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            11/27/23 - 12/01/23 Week 14 <br>
            This week in Engineering we worked on our Shark Tank Pitch slides <br>
            to further learn about Business Engineering. The product I decided to <br>
            create was a mascara to improve the health of your eyelashes without <br>
            damaging them. I did research on different serums that you could use <br>
            to improve the growth of your eyelashes and I found a serum called <br>
            bimatoprost. I thought about what could make the product more <br>
            environmental friendly by saying that the product doesn't test on <br>
            animals. I thought about a reasonable price that would allow the <br>
            product to thrive. My favorite pitch was the scrub doggy because<br>
            I felt like it was a reasonable product that people would actually <br>
            want to buy. <br>

                S2 Week 1 <br>
                This week in engineering we learned about chemical engineering. <br>
                To help further learn about it we did a project where we had to <br>
                make Oobleck. While doing the project we had to make sure that <br>
                we added water little by little being too much water would <br>
                overactivate the product and too little would cause it to be hard <br>
                and not have the correct consistency. To make it right we had to <br>
                slowly add water to the corn starch to make sure that we had <br>
                a hard consistency when you would lift it up and a gooey wet <br>
                consistency when it's all joined together. This taught me that <br>
                you have to follow directions thouroughly to make sure that you <br>
                get what you wanted successfuly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                S2 Week 2 <br>
                We started designing and writing a proposal for our mouse <br>
                trap car project. We researched and found out that the point <br>
                of the mouse trap is to collect and store energy causing <br>
                the car to move forward. When using bigger wheels the car <br>
                will travel a further distance and the lever that's <br>
                connected to the mouse trap should be long. Without <br>
                traction the car wastes energy towards the beginnings <br>
                which will cause the car to slow down and travel a smaller <br>
                distance than your desired distance. Making sure that the <br>
                car is the perfect weight will highly affect the distance and <br>
                speed of the car because if the car is too heavy it will put weight <br>
                down on the wheels and if the car is too light, the wheels <br>
                may not even stay on the ground. If the car moves slower, <br>
                it maximizeds energy as it stores energy while the car moves. <br>

            <p>
                S2 Week 3 <br>
                The process for building the car is going good. Finding the <br>
                calculations for the car is very confusing and hard to do. <br>
                If we start building this week I think I'd want to start <br>
                by buildig the base of the car and building the wheels. <br>
                Last week we worked on a worksheet to help us better <br>
                understand the calculations and how the car works and how <br>
                it's different features function. I think figuring out <br>
                how to make the car go further is going to be the more <br>
                difficult part of the project since we're not worried <br>
                about the speed of the car. <br>
                <img src = "tink.png">

            <p>
                S2 Week 4 <br>
                This week we continued to work on our mouse trap and we <br>
                actually started building. I started by building the wheels <br>
                and figuring out how I can attach the wheels to the base. <br>
                I cut out a rectangular shape of cardboard for the shape <br>
                of the base. I attached the wheels to each other by using <br>
                a stick thing. To make sure that the wheels would spin <br>
                I put the stick in a straw so that the stick could spin in <br>
                the straw without the cardboard stopping the wheels from moving. <br>
                We glued on the mouse trap to the top of the car once we finished <br>
                the wheels. Next week we're planning on figuring out how we can <br>
                attach the dowel and the string to actually get the car to move <br>
                without the dowel bending or breaking. 
                <img src = "first car.jpg">
            </p>
            <p>
                S2 Week 5 & 6 <br>
                We learned that our original design didn't have enough string <br>
                which affected the distance of the car. The wheels caused <br>
                the car to go in a different direction (to the right) <br>
                rather than to the left. The wheels in the front were attached <br>
                too closely to the car, and the wheels were facing the right <br>
                but we weren't able to fix the way it was facing. It didn't go <br>
                far enough because the shape of the car was incorrect and the <br>
                dowel and string were too short. For the second design, we made <br>
                it smaller because the smaller it is the less it will weigh but <br>
                it'll still stay on the floor. I'll add more string to ensure <br>
                that it goes further. The distance for the first car was 25 feet. <br>
                The percent error was 35%. On the second car, we made it smaller <br>
                so that just the mouse trap fits on the cardboard. We made the <br>
                dowel longer than the size of the cardboard and attached to the <br>
                middle of the car so that it's longer. We added a lot more <br>
                string to the car so that it would go further. We're going <br>
                to fix the way we attached to the wheels so that it goes straight <br>
                this time.

         S2 Week 7 <br>
         This week we tested our mouse trap cars and ours didn't go exactly <br>
         as we expected. It didn't go straight because we put the wheels <br>
         in an incorrect position. Our car went 40 feet which we saw as an <br>
         improvement. Even though it didn't go as far as it was supposed to <br>
         it went further than our first car which means the things we fixed <br>
         changed and it worked like how we wanted it to. If we had more time <br>
         I would change the size of the car. Making it smaller was a big <br>
         mistake and we put on the dowel and string incorrectly which <br>
         I would fix if I had more time. <br>

         S2 Week 8 <br>
         This week we started by doing our egg drop design. We made ours <br>
         a small box using cardboard. Our idea was to put cotton balls <br>
         inside the cardboard with the egg to make sure that it doesn't <br>
         crck when it lands. We're going to add a parachute to the box <br>
         so that it'll go down slowly. The plan for this week is to finish <br>
         making the box and making sure it's stable for when we test it. <br>
         We also did a doors and wheels challenge where we had to find out <br>
         if there were more doors or wheels at the school. When we walked <br>
         around the school we realized that there are a bunch of classrooms <br>
         which all have at least 1 or more doors. People drive cars and each <br>
         car has four doors. There are at least 5000 lockers at the school. <br>
