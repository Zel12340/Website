            8/21/23 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned what a Rube <br>
            Rube Goldberg machine is. I  also learned how to keep myself safe in <br>
            class. We saw different videos on how to keep ourselves safe, what <br>
            the consequences are for not keeping yourself safe, and what may <br>
            happen if you don't use the proper safety materials. I also <br>
            learned basic codes amd how to use AWS. We got introduced <br>
            to different websites including GitHub. To end our week we did <br>
            a game with marbles and sticks to see which team could finish <br>
            the fastest. <br>

            8/28/23 - 9/01/2023 Week 2 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering I learned how to use <br>
            TinkerCad and we took our first quiz. We learned more about <br>
            Mechanical Engineering and safety in engineering class. <br>
            Ms. Petrosian showed us multiple videos on safety, and <br>
            one on ivention and innovation. We began to plan out our <br>
            Rube Goldberg machines with our groups and began to build <br>
            it on TinkerCad. We also took notes on mechanical engineering <br>
            safety, and how to be successful in the engineering process.<br>

            9/05/23 - 9/08/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we started our first phase of <br>
            building our Rube Goldberg machines. We came across some <br>
            complications but soon overcame them and began our project.<br>
            We used our example from TinkerCad to help us build it.<br>
            We built the layout of the project and are looking for more <br>
            inspiration to help us build the machine. <br>

            9/11/23 - 9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we finished our Rube <br>
            Goldberg Machines. Due to my partner being sick and having <br>
            to leave multiple groups, we fell behind but still managed <br>
            to finish the project. It was a little frustrating to build it <br>
            but we came up with multiple different ideas and we were <br>
            successful. We failed multiple times but we fixed the problems <br>
            and learned from our mistakes. We're going to test our project <br>
            next Monday to see if our machine was a success. <br>

            9/18/23 - 9/22/23 Week 5 <br>
            Thi week in Intro to Engineering we did two different challenges. <br>
            We did a challenge on a flotation device to see whos could last <br>
            the longest. At first I wasn't positive that it was going to work <br>
            due to it being too heavy, but then I removed some weights and it <br>
            allowed it to float. Our second project was to make a paper E with <br>
            the proper dimensions. I made my 'E' a little too big causing the<br>
            person that built the 'E' to face complications. <br>
            
            </p>
            <p> 
            9/25/23 - 9/29/23 Week 6 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering we dissected a computer. <br>
            We learned the different components and parts of a computer. <br> 
            We took a quiz on what we learned about the different parts <br>
            of a computer and on computer engineering. I feel like I learned <br>
            a lot more on what there is to know about engineering. We did a <br>
            worksheet to remember how much we know about the different parts <br>
            inside a computer. Although I found it a little challenging I got <br>
            help and learned something new from it.<br>

            10/02/23 - 10/06/23 Week 7 <br>
            This week in engineering we learned more about BioEngineering and <br>
            what it does to help people. We did a worksheet on it to help us <br>
            learn more about it and we did a project on it. We made prosthetic <br>
            hands using carboard to pick up a water bottle. It was kind of hard <br>
            to do because we kept messing up and we didn't know to do to fix it <br>
            and so it made the challenge more difficult for us. Also to help <br>
            us learn more about BioEngineering we did another assignment on <br>
            TinkerCad to make an animal prosthetic that works efficiently <br>
            for the animal. <br>

            <p>
            10/09/23 - 10/14/23 Week 8 <br>
            This week in engineering we took a quiz on BioEngineering to test <br>
            our knowledge on the topic. We started a new topic on aerospace <br>
            engineering which I'm very interested in and want to learn more <br>
            about it. We're starting a new project next week and joined new <br>
            groups. I'm looking forward to the new project, making a rocket <br>
            out of a coke bottle, because it seems like a fun project <br>
            and I think it's something that can help me learn more about aerospace <br>
            engineering. Even thought it may be more challenging I feel like <br>
            it's something that can teach me more about what there is to know <br>
            about engineering.

            10/16/23 - 10/20/23 Week 9 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineering, to help us learn more about <br>
            aerospace engineering, we made rockets out of coke bottles. <br>
            To make our bottle fly we gave it wings made out of cardboard. <br>
            We had to add the right amount of water to make sure that it flys <br>
            to the distance that we wanted it to go to. Overall, our test project <br>
            went really well and I expected it to be worst, it went pretty far <br>
            but it definitely went further then we thought it would've gone. <br>
            We used 50 pr and if we had to do something different I would <br>
            probably change the wings to make it fly more efficiently. <br>
            
            <p>
            10/23/23 - 10/27/23 Week 10 <br>
            This week in Intro to Engineer we learned about environmental <br>
            engineering and I learned that evnironmental engineering <br>
            is meant to help the environment and find solutions <br>
            to the problems that our environment has. Our water clarification <br>
            project went really well and I think that the color was just a little <br>
            yellow at the end. The order of our project was first cotton then rocks <br>
            then pebbles then sand. Our water was sort of clear but it could've been <br> clearer. I would put the rocks on the bottom then the cotton. <br>
